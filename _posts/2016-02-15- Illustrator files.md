title: Files for lamp
---
<p>The files developed for trialing our lamp to be cut on the lazer cutter</p>
<p><u>material-</u>ply=4mm</p>

<p>-Changes to the scale,and pieces needed to make the structure</p>
<p>-Extra parts made in file incasewe have worked out how it fits together. Also needed to make parts more stonger and supportive</p>
<p>-Working with similar shapes to keep simplistic.</p>

<p>-Not the final file for the lamp base, only slight changes to be made from this to make more durable and accessable for the electronics to working with the inside of the sturcture. </p>
<p>-Engraved branding withing the file on separate parts of the lamp.</p>
