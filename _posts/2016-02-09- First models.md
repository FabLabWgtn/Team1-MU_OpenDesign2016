<p>Our first model works really well. It is able to move into different positions by having notches that can keep the lamps in a certain place without moving by itself. It is quite chunky and the lamp head is heavy looking in comparison to other lights already designed.</p>

<p><u>Changes:</u></p>

<p>-When you move one side (leg), the other side should move in unison</p>
<p>-Base is quite chunky looking and takes away from the height of lamp. Make base at bottom.</p>
<p>-Lock the short arm to make more secure.</p>
<p>-Top raling come lower, make base smaller.</p>
