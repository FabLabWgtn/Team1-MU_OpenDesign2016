<p>This is the digital workbook of a Massey University Wellington Open Design and Digital Fabrication (198.320) student team, known as <strong>Team Wavy</strong>. 

<p>Our team members consists of:</p> 

<ul>
   <li>Devon Mahoney (Fashion Design)</li>
   <li>Ron Christiansen (Motion Graphics)</li>
   <li> Jan Louise Ballesfin (Interior/Industrial Design)</li>
   <li>Elliot Gonzales (Industrial Design/Illustration)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Manifesto</h3>

<p>Our team has a wide range of design specialisations, which allows for the overseeing of certain areas of expertise. Collectively we aim to face this project with a flexible approach to task delegation. This means that our specialisations will not limit the scope of our contributions to the project, which will allow for an openness to learning if a member wants to lead or assist on a task.</p>

<p>This way of converging differing interests and coordinating the outcome will be paired with a focus on designing for fine aesthetic, a sense of wonder, inspiration for innovation, and the encouragement of open design through accessibility.</p>
