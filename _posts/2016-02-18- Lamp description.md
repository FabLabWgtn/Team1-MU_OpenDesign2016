<p>The Orbit lamp is a interchangable, open design lamp to be downloaded, customized and assembled using Polar ply 4mm (A/A grade) and a simple arduino circuit to control the LEDâ€™s.</p>

<p>Using movements of the hand, the lamp is able to turn on, off and change its brightness using an ultra sonic sensor.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we have uploaded a series of 2 interchangable lamp heads that create different light patterns and have a range of movements that ideally express their structure.</p>
