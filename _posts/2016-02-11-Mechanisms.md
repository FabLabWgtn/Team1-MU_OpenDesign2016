<h2>Assembling the Iris Mechanism </h2>

<p>- Jan found a step by step tutorial of how to make a lazercut file of the iris technique</p>

<p>- This idea is developed from the panel shutting concept and working towards opening and closing areas that can shut off light and exposed</p>

<p>- This idea worked really well, it worked better than the other panel shutting concept.
For example:
-Had a range of continued movement
-It wouldnt lock in a certain point
-The lazercut ply smoothly wwent with other parts of ply</p>
