<p> Material Analysis:</p>


<p>Wood:</p>

<p>There are many different types therefore giving different textures, patterns, and qualities ( water , shape, durability, weight..etc)</p>

<p>-Easy to manipulate in digital fabrication and by hand.</p>

<p>Easy to get and is most likely our cheapest option depending on what wood we choose and how much we need. Eg: bamboo or ply</p>

<p>Mirror:</p>

<p>Will bounce light and patterns across a space with the help of light</p>.

<p>- Will create an illusion of space and quantity. As well as enhancing object / space it is placed.</p>

<p>Acrylic:</p>

<p>Is a transparent thermo plastic that can come in many colours.</p>

<p>Is used as an alternative / shatter proof glass.
Is easy to source and is of a cheap nature (dependable).</p>

<p>- Can be laser cut and used to reflect and change light.</p>

<p>Metal:</p>

<p>Metal is typically a hard, opaque, and shiny material. Like copper it has high thermal and electrical conductivity.</p>

<p>- Metal can be moulded and pressed into many shapes. Through its ability to heat, metal can be persuaded and changed and then cooled down without the quality of the metal changing. </p>

<p>Glass:</p>

<p>- Is a transparent material that can be made out of sand. Is used to reflect and let in light. The glass process takes a long time as it needs to go through the stages of being fluid to solid (heated to very high temperatures.</p>

<p>- Can be sourced easily.</p>

<p>-Goes hand in hand with light and emphasises its qualities.</p>

<p>Copper:</p>

<p>-Copper is a soft, malleable and ductile metal. It has a very high thermal and electrical conductivity. When freshly exposed the surface of pure copper has a reddish-orangey colour. It is mainly used as a conductor of heat and electricity, a building material, or a constituent of various metal alloys.</p>

<p>-Is available at many hardware stores.</p>

<p>Plastic:</p>

<p>-A material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organics. Plastic is malleable and has the qualities to be moulded. Due to they're relatively low cost, ease of manufacture, versatility, and durability with water, plastics are used in an enormous and expanding range of products, from paper clips to spaceships.</p>

<p>- Plastic is used in many digital fabrication forms.</p>

<p>- Can be made into whatever is needed and whatever aesthetic is required.</p>

<p>Concrete:</p>

<p>- Is a composite material made out of aggregate and fluid concrete that eventually hardens over time ( 7 days for strengthening and approximately 28 days for full strength ). Concretes initial strength can virtually be done over years. Factors to take into account - fluidity and stiffness. Limestone, granite and limestone are key components to making concrete.</p>

<p>- Concrete is a sturdy and easy to get. However it does take awhile to dry and can get quite heavy.</p>
