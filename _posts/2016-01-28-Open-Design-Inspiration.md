<p>inspired by the work of Reuben Margolin these kinetic sculptures use a simple mechanic to create organic movement.This work has huge potential to be developed and applied to the Kerf Lamp.</p>

<p>The original "Round Wave" done by Reuben Margolin uses wire rather than a single Central rotating axile as seen in the previous videos. One of the major focuses of Reuben Margolin's work is the mathematics which he explains in the following video.</p>

<p>Outside of the organic result of this effect the great range of motion achievable through manipulating one component. Taking the concept of 'The ripple effect' and applying light, shadow, opacity and form We (Team Wavy) have a good grounding to start developing from.</p>
