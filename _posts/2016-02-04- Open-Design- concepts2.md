* this idea turns the shell sigments into peices you can slot into place, they are lifted by a card thickness leaver (A,B,C or D) through card sized openings in the middle of each hole.
 * +this idea avoids the issues faces when having arms raise from the same rotating axis
 * -this idea os complicated and there may be issues if the card leavers exit the card slots as they try to realign

* Using the same concept as the original beatle design this would advoid all the problems of having a curved side rotating off a streight axis
 * +would be simple and easy to make
 * -Does not seem to reflect the artist role model and has no desernable use of the distance sensor

*a box idea would allow more light through gradually and could be more applicable as a light source.
*could be rotated onto a corner and animated functioning as a standing version of the artist role model
 *-would be difficult to rotate more than three sides and the two sides next to the animated ones would ver visually unsatisfying next to the motion of the aother sides.

*the same concept as above but as a box on the ground, visually has a lot of potental and could have more than just one or two animated sections communicating with each other.

*referencing back to the artist role model and a simple devalopment which will avoid most of the problems that have become evident researching the beatle concept.

*A persuit of a simplar concept these are some basic concept of how to animate the orignial role models work

*a look into ways of manually restricting the flow of light

*through the movement of thet light itself interesting patterns as well as siloettes would be projected on the walls.

*The superior concept
 *+works from the artist role model, adding new functionallity without changing the core features.
 *+has a lot of possiblities in terms of aethetic with the large surface area of the legs and head
