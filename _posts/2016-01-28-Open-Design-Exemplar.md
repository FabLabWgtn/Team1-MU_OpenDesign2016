<p>Our team was required to select an Open Design exemplar piece in order to provide a basis for reference, exploration and research. We chose to explore the <strong><u>Kerf Lamp</u></strong>
Out of the three options offered it was the more refined design that had aspects which were still open to development, reflecting the nature of open source design. We saw lighting as a rich form of design, with many opportunities in designing with physical form and electronics.</p>

<p>The qualities of light are wide ranging and has potential for a mesmerising result. 
This project in particular utilises motion and proximity activation to control the brightness of an LED strip. The light hence emanates through the enclosing structure of the lamp.

Kerf Lamp main attributes - Free standing lighting piece - Sensor activated and controlled light with adjustable dimming - Laser cut exterior creating a patterned shadow in the room - Easily downloadable and modifiable </p>
