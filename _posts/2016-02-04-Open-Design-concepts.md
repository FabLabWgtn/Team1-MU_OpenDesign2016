* Concept behind adaptions of Reuben Margolin's Round wave.

###Aim to create a dynamic and modifyable ripple effect
![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/2.jpg)
* this idea uses stoppers hitting a base level to provide a minimum height
* the rotation bar disengages from the rods when lowered.
 * -Effect would be juttery when half engaged, with full range of movement rising into the kenitic movement instead of gradual change.

* Raises all bars to disengage the rotation bar.
 * -This is not the desired effe3ct  as more light would escape while it is disengaged.

* Uses leverage to change the ratio of movement between the two sections of the arms.
 * +would achieve the desired effect
 * -would require three joints per arm, each ripple having two arms, a minimum of 18 joints.
 * -would require a tall base to include full leghth required to use mechanic

* a more in depth look in to how the mechanics would work in previous idea.

* two ways of acheiveing the same effect.

* Enclosure as proposed by Elliot
 * Visually interesting.
 * -May have limitations in prodution acheiving width as well as the curve

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/8.jpg)
* same principal, using 3D# printed sections in clear arcrilic
* idea is to defuse the light on the body but pollish cicular secions to allow for directional light to pass trough creating more interesting silloettes.
 * issues may arise when trying to polish or rough up surfeces

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/9.jpg)
* Differnt shapes using the same principal of blocking out sections of light
 * needs mechanics reimmagined to provide funtionality

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/10.jpg)
* Incorpirating the artist role models aethetic of holloweed out sections into the panels.
 * +visually interesting and as panels overlap it would create very interesting effects.

* a seccond layer of the original work to create moving silloettes on the walls.
 * +visually interesting
 * +well documented and easy to replicate

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/12.jpg)
* experimenting with differnt shapes to block out the light
 * +with the implamentation of material to create visual disrotions we are incorpriating another aspect of team Wave into the project.

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/13.jpg)
* floowing through with the idea of material in the project this concept uses the mechanics of [Reuben Margolin's Round wave]({{site.baseurl}}/Examplars/Water Experiment Automata)
 * +mechanic would work
 * +Has a lot of room for devalopment
 * -A lot of work for the project breif

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/14.jpg)
* Over lapping opaic waves aimed in creating a oceanainic imagery on the walls.
 * +Has a clearly adetifyable audiance of parents 

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/waves mechcanics concept.png)
* a more indepth look into the mechanics of the wave form silloete

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/15.jpg)
* a look into the mechanics which would enable uneven and controlable lift to each of the shell sigments.
 * -If the outer edge of the shape is curved each of the shell sigments will lift in the exact same way leaving a big gap on the curve close to the rotating axis
  * When talking to a mechanic he suggested the way around this would be to have a stepper curve on the axal like a gear box however there would be issues in attaching the sigments as well as having steps without making gaps between sections of the shell sigments

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/16.jpg)
* this idea turns the shell sigments into peices you can slot into place, they are lifted by a card thickness leaver (A,B,C or D) through card sized openings in the middle of each hole.
 * +this idea avoids the issues faces when having arms raise from the same rotating axis
 * -this idea os complicated and there may be issues if the card leavers exit the card slots as they try to realign

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/17.jpg)
* Using the same concept as the original beatle design this would advoid all the problems of having a curved side rotating off a streight axis
 * +would be simple and easy to make
 * -Does not seem to reflect the artist role model and has no desernable use of the distance sensor

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/18.jpg)
*a box idea would allow more light through gradually and could be more applicable as a light source.
*could be rotated onto a corner and animated functioning as a standing version of the artist role model
 *-would be difficult to rotate more than three sides and the two sides next to the animated ones would ver visually unsatisfying next to the motion of the aother sides.

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/19.jpg)
*the same concept as above but as a box on the ground, visually has a lot of potental and could have more than just one or two animated sections communicating with each other.

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/20.jpg)
*referencing back to the artist role model and a simple devalopment which will avoid most of the problems that have become evident researching the beatle concept.

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/21.jpg)
*A persuit of a simplar concept these are some basic concept of how to animate the orignial role models work

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/25.jpg)
*a look into ways of manually restricting the flow of light

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/24.jpg)
*through the movement of thet light itself interesting patterns as well as siloettes would be projected on the walls.

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/30.JPG)
*The superior concept
 *+works from the artist role model, adding new functionallity without changing the core features.
 *+has a lot of possiblities in terms of aethetic with the large surface area of the legs and head
