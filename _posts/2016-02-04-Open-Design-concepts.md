* Concept behind adaptions of Reuben Margolin's Round wave.

###Aim to create a dynamic and modifyable ripple effect
![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/2.jpg)
* this idea uses stoppers hitting a base level to provide a minimum height
* the rotation bar disengages from the rods when lowered.
 * -Effect would be juttery when half engaged, with full range of movement rising into the kenitic movement instead of gradual change.

* Raises all bars to disengage the rotation bar.
 * -This is not the desired effe3ct  as more light would escape while it is disengaged.

* Uses leverage to change the ratio of movement between the two sections of the arms.
 * +would achieve the desired effect
 * -would require three joints per arm, each ripple having two arms, a minimum of 18 joints.
 * -would require a tall base to include full leghth required to use mechanic

* a more in depth look in to how the mechanics would work in previous idea.

* two ways of acheiveing the same effect.

* Enclosure as proposed by Elliot
 * Visually interesting.
 * -May have limitations in prodution acheiving width as well as the curve

* same principal, using 3D# printed sections in clear arcrilic
* idea is to defuse the light on the body but pollish cicular secions to allow for directional light to pass trough creating more interesting silloettes.
 * issues may arise when trying to polish or rough up surfeces

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/9.jpg)
* Differnt shapes using the same principal of blocking out sections of light
 * needs mechanics reimmagined to provide funtionality

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/10.jpg)
* Incorpirating the artist role models aethetic of holloweed out sections into the panels.
 * +visually interesting and as panels overlap it would create very interesting effects.

* a seccond layer of the original work to create moving silloettes on the walls.
 * +visually interesting
 * +well documented and easy to replicate

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/12.jpg)
* experimenting with differnt shapes to block out the light
 * +with the implamentation of material to create visual disrotions we are incorpriating another aspect of team Wave into the project.

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/13.jpg)
* floowing through with the idea of material in the project this concept uses the mechanics of [Reuben Margolin's Round wave]({{site.baseurl}}/Examplars/Water Experiment Automata)
 * +mechanic would work
 * +Has a lot of room for devalopment
 * -A lot of work for the project breif

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/working/concepts/14.jpg)
* Over lapping opaic waves aimed in creating a oceanainic imagery on the walls.
 * +Has a clearly adetifyable audiance of parents

* a more indepth look into the mechanics of the wave form silloete
